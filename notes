Try adding noise to elution traces before Pearson
Look at how network behaves on model traces as opposed to garbage ones

Feed synthetic good and bad data through the network to see performance
Plot intermediate traces between convolutions

Looked through Pearson histograms of individual .elut files. Noticed several
files that appear to have far less discrimination between +/- PPIs with Pearson.
Will attempt deleting these and rerunning the model.
Files to delete:
17
18
22
23
24
25
26
27
30
31
32
33

Will also threshold minimum Pearson scores for positive PPIs at 0.2, s.t. all
positive PPIs with Pearson < 0.2 are omitted from the training data

Result: worse model performance
